list and display wins, losses, guesses remaining, player guesses so far

JS

initialize variables for random letter, wins, losses, guesses remaining, player guesses so far 

Start a new game:

Set wins, losses = 0
{ Set gueses remaining = 9
Set player gueses to empty string } or do these only on new play round

Start a new round:

Pick a new random letter
Reset guesses remaining to 9
Set player gueses to empty string

Inside round

Listen for keystrokes, convert to guessed letter

If it is not a letter, ignore
Is it right? Increment wins and exit loop
Is it wrong? Decrement guesses remaining, append guess to player guesses
Is it already guessed? Ignore


Refresh display (all at once?)
Take values from variables and put them into the id'd spans
Make a string of player guesses so far from the array
